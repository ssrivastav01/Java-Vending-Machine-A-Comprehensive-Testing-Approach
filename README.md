# Java-Vending-Machine-A-Comprehensive-Testing-Approach
This project focuses on testing the VendingMachine class in a Java-based vending machine application. The testing approach includes:

Model-Based Testing: Test cases are derived from a state-transition model of the vending machine, covering various state transitions and input combinations.

Ghost Transition Testing: Test cases are designed to verify the behavior of the vending machine under unexpected or invalid inputs (ghost transitions).

Multiple Condition Testing: Test cases are developed to assess the vending machine's response to multiple conditions within its logic, ensuring correct behavior under different scenarios.

**Test Suite:**

A comprehensive test suite is created, consisting of 34 test cases. Each test case outlines a sequence of actions and expected outcomes, covering a wide range of vending machine operations.

**Test Execution:**

The test cases are executed against the vending machine implementation. The results of each test case are recorded, indicating whether it passed or failed.

**Failed Test Cases:**

While no test cases explicitly failed, an observation is made regarding the default transition behavior always leading to the "Idle" state, which might not be the intended behavior in all cases.

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully demonstrates the application of various testing techniques to validate the functionality of a vending machine. The test suite provides a valuable resource for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the vending machine software. The observation regarding the default transition behavior highlights a potential area for further investigation and improvement in the vending machine's logic.
